### How it works:
You first have to create an application on the [Spotify developer website](https://developers.spotify.com/dashboard), then it will ask you to put in the client id and client secret. After that it will log you in with your Spotify account. You can search songs with the Spotify api. It then makes a Youtube search query `"${song_name}"+lyrics` (Can customize) to get the most relavent video then downloads it through youtube-dl. After it has been saved as an `.m4a` file the corresponding metadata is attached to the file e.g. the album cover, the title, the artist, etc.

# Running
currently the only method is to run from source, this will change in the future.

# Running from source
Dependencies: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [python](https://www.python.org), [pip](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)<br/>
First you'll have to clone the repo do so by running the following commands.
```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/deter0/Music-Player
```
then cd into the `/Run/Linux` folder and if not installed do.
```bash
$ bash ./install.bash
```
after installation of modules has finished. Simply run the `/Run/Linux/Run.bash` script.
```bash
$ bash ./run.bash
```
or manually do it by cd into `/ReactApp/app/` and running
```bash
$ npm start
```
and in a seperate terminal tab run the server by cd'ing into `/Server` and also running
```bash
$ npm start
```

**After running** It will take you through a first time setup. If you somehow happen to input it wrong (don't be ashamed I've done it) you can see all the data in `/Server/Data`. Primarily the first time setup data is stored in `/Server/Data/Paths.txt` simply edit it and then restart the server. I will likely include this in settings page in the future.
